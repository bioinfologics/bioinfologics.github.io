      <description>Motivation
For the last 5 years, I have been advocating the analysis of k-mer spectra (in short, the frequencies at which different k-mers appear on different datasets) to evaluate genome assemblies. I have been using k-mers for many other analyses too, as do most people doing Bioinformatics. And I also train others to perform k-mer analyses and have a long overdue debt to them to write down a more coherent version of the training.</description>
